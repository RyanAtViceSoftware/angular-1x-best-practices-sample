# Angular 1.x Best Practices
Sample code from my Angular 1.x Best Practices and Lessons Learned talk. In this talk I'm covering best practices that I've used successfully with large distributed teams on large code bases for high volume sites over long periods of time.

## Running Code

1. Clone repository or download zip file and extract it.
1. Start a local server by executing ```http-server```
1. Browse to IP and port created by http-server, http://127.0.0.1:8080/ on my machine

## Running Tests

1. ```karma start```
